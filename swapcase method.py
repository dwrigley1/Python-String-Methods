'''
The swapcase() method makes a new string by swapping the cases of all letters within the source string: lower-case characters become upper-case, and vice versa.
All other characters remain untouched.

# Demonstrating the swapcase() method:
print("I know that I know nothing.".swapcase()) # output -> i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING.

print("PYTHON IS FUN".swapcase()) # output -> python is fun

print("do you enjoy python?".swapcase()) # output -> DO YOU ENJOY PYTHON?
